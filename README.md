1.      Propane fuel (C3   H8) is burned with stoichiometric   amount of oxygen.   Determine      the mole fraction of carbon dioxide and water in the   products. Also, calculate the   mole   number of carbon dioxide in the products   per unit   mole   of fuel   burned.
2.    A fuel   mixture of 60% by   mass   methane   (CH4) and 40%   by   mass   ethanol
(C2   H6O) is burned completely with theoretical air.   If the flow   rate   of the fuel   is   10   kg/s, what is the flow   rate of air?
3.    A constant-volume tank contains a   mixture   of   1   kmol   of benzene   (C6   H6)   gas   and   30% excess air at 25oC and   1 atm. The contents of the tankare   ignited, and   all the   hydrogen   in the fuel burns to   H2O, but only 92%   of the carbon   burns   to   CO2 with the   remaining 8% going to CO.   If the final temperature   in the tank   is   1000K,   determine the heat transfer from the combustion chamber during this process.
4.    A fuel is burnt first with oxygen,   then   with   air.   Which   case   will   have   a   high代 写MAE 115 APPLIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS Hw#9Haskell

5.      Hydrogen (H2) at 27oC   is burned with 50%   excess air   that   is   also   at   27oC.
Combustion occurs at constant pressure, at steady flow, and   in an   adiabatic
container. Assuming complete combustion, what is the exit temperature of the   gases?
6.      Methane at 298K (CH4) is burned with   80%   excess   air   at   1   atm   and   298   K.   Determine the following:
a)    Considering the production of both   NO   and   CO, the system   of equations   required to solve for the adiabatic flame temperature   of this reaction.
b)    The adiabatic flame temperature of this   reaction
7.    Answer   the   following   questions
a.    Above   what   temperature   would   you   expect   the   dissociation   of   diatomic   hydrogen (H2) to monatomic   hydrogen   (H)?
b.      Is the equilibrium process 2/1N2 + 2/1O2 ↔   NO influenced   by diluents?
c.      Is the which reaction direction is favored   at 3000K for the following   reaction (forwards or backwards?):   O2 ↔   2O
